Terms of Use: Users accessing the United TLD WHOIS service agree to use the data only for lawful purposes, and under no circumstances may this data be used to: Allow, enable, or otherwise support the transmission by e-mail, telephone, or facsimile of mass unsolicited, commercial advertising or solicitations to entities other than the registrar's own existing customers. Enable high volume, automated, electronic processes that send queries or data to the systems of United TLD or any ICANN-accredited registrar, except as reasonably necessary to register domain names or modify existing registrations. When using the United TLD Whois service, please consider the following: The Whois service is not a replacement for standard EPP commands to the SRS service. Whois is not considered authoritative for registered domain objects. The Whois service may be scheduled for downtime during production or OT&E maintenance periods. Queries to the Whois services are throttled. If too many queries are received from a single IP address within a specified time, the service will begin to reject further queries for a period of time to prevent disruption of Whois service access. Abuse of the Whois system through data mining is mitigated by detecting and limiting bulk query access from single sources.
